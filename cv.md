### About me âœ¨

 I am an aspiring web developer eager to create engaging and complex website designs while writing clean and functional code. I have a passion for learning and reading, currently delving into various materials on UX/UI design, the basics of web development, and JavaScript. Though I am at the beginning of my journey, I am not afraid to tackle tasks beyond my current level to learn new skills in the process. My strong soft skills and extensive experience working with people and in team settings make me an excellent collaborator. I am committed to continuous learning, which is why I have enrolled in the Rolling Scopes School. Through these courses, I aim to fill knowledge gaps and master JavaScript.
